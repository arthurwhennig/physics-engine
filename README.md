# Physics Engine

A simple 2D physics engine implemented in C++. This engine includes rigid body dynamics, 
collision detection and response, force generation, and numerical integration.

### Core Physics Components
- **Vector2D**: Complete 2D vector math library with operations for physics calculations
- **RigidBody**: Dynamic and static rigid bodies (circle, point, line or polygon) with mass, velocity, and force properties
- **PhysicsWorld**: Physics simulation manager handling timestep integration
- **CollisionDetector**: Circle-circle collision detection and resolution
- **ForceGenerator**: Modular force application system
